# 🌍 IoT-Based Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring System

This project is an IoT-based system for monitoring real-time environmental conditions such as **Air Quality Index (AQI)**, **temperature**, and **humidity**. The data is collected using sensors and displayed on a Flutter-based mobile application. The app also includes AI-based predictions for upcoming air quality and environmental trends.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- ESP32 with MQ135 and DHT11 sensors
- Arduino C++ for firmware
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- Flutter (Dart) for mobile app
- TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for on-device AI predictions

## 📱 Features
- Real-time sensor data via WebSocket
- Historical graph (7 days)
- AI prediction for next 2–3 days
- Product suggestions based on AQI
- Mobile-first UI with offline support
